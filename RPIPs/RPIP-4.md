## Abstract
The Rocket Pool community at large agrees to use RPL token quadratic voting for governance proposals via the snapshot.org platform. Snapshot votes which pass are immediately adopted and the protocol DAO will endeavor to enact it as soon as reasonably possible.

## Motivation
Governance in Rocket Pool is currently ad hoc. There is no way for the community to adopt proposals or legitimately request or pay for work. We must adopt a governance mechanism, even if imperfect, before any governance actions can be taken legitimately, such as but not limited to spending pDAO funds.
  
Snapshot.org is a web3-native platform for token voting and provides several strategies for accomplishing this, such as 1-to-1 voting and qudratic voting.

## Security Considerations
As with any token-based voting mechanism, even quadratic voting allows large actors to influence the outcome of votes. Although this risk is significantly lower with quadratic voting vs 1-to-1 token votes, it is possible that a large actor may create a proposal which harms the security of the protocol and force it to be adopted via this mechanism.
